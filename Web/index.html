            <p> At The Outlook Hotel, we strive to provide no less than extraordinary guest experiences. The wellbeing
                of our guests, visitors, and the team is our main priority, so you can feel safe from check-in to
                check-out, and everywhere in between. Here’s what we do based on guidelines from our local health
                authorities.</p>
            <p> SOCIAL DISTANCING – We make sure to keep a safe distance between guests and the team.</p>
            <p> THE TEAM – is all trained in hygiene protocols that prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and make
                you feel safe. They wash and sanitize hands after every encounter. Hands are dried with paper, not
                towels. Every colleague is required to stay home if feeling unwell.</p>
            <p> CLEAN SURFACES - We clean and disinfect surfaces frequently throughout the day with special attention to
                high-touch areas. We are using high-level hygiene products, that still live up to the environmental
                requirements and our sustainable code of conduct.</p>
            <p>THE ROOMS – We use disinfectant detergents and make sure to pay extra attention to high-touch items</p>
            <p> We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and follow the recommendations of our local health
                authorities. </p>

            <h3> Organic breakfast now at our hotel!</h3>
            <p>A good day doesn't have to start with our Good Morning. It's Organic! breakfast - but it usually does. At
                all our hotels we serve an entire buffet of healthy breakfast - and when we call it organic, we mean it
                - over 90% of the breakfast is organic. You will always find freshly baked bread, breakfast cereal,
                seasonal fruits, delicious juices, smoothies and much more. We could go on and on, but you'd do better
                trying it for yourself.</p>

            <h3> Renovations in our hotel</h3>
            <p>Dear Valued Guest,
            <p>
            <p> Please be advised that our Guestrooms and Hallway areas will be under renovations starting February,
                2021. I am thrilled to announce that our highly anticipated interior renovation has begun, with the
                expected completion date of late August, 2021. While our hotel remains a preferred choice of many
                families and business travellers alike, these renovations will allow us to provide the very best hotel
                experience to our valued clients. </p>
            <p>During the renovation period, we apologize for any inconvenience and offer our sincere thanks for your
                patience and support</p>

        <p>"My first trip to Copenhagen the hotel was absolutely fantastic the staff was good the hotel with clean they
            gave me really good directions and they were very helpful when I had questions about the area. Can't say
            enough good things about this hotel. And it's right across the street from the airport so it's
            convenient"</p>

        <p> "Excellent hotel. All areas of hotel (bedrooms,bathrooms,dining area and foyer) are spotlessly clean. Staff
            extremely helpful. Really good buffet breakfast plenty of choice. Also found the secure parking a bonus as
            we had a very full car, having just come from the ferry. Would definitely stay at this hotel again."</p>
